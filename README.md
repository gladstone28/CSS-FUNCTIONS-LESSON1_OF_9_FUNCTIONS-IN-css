# CSS FUNCTIONS

## Functions in CSS

> At this point in our CSS journey, we’ve already been exposed to a few CSS functions—for example the var() and repeat() functions. But the possibilities and usefulness that CSS functions bring are much farther reaching.

> In a broad sense, functions are blocks of organized and reusable code that help to perform a single, related action. Functions have the benefit of keeping code modular and allowing for a high degree of reusability.

> Functions in CSS are a little more limiting than most programming languages. We cannot create our own functions in CSS but instead have access to a wide variety of predefined functions, which allow for expansive page styling.

> To use a function in CSS, follow the standard functional notation syntax:

```js
h1 {
  property: function-name(argument);
}

```

> Functions are a type of CSS value that is inserted in the place of a hardcoded value of a CSS declaration. Some functions can even take multiple arguments, generally each of which must be separated by a comma.

> By the end of this lesson, you will be able to use some of the most common and beneficial CSS functions. You will also feel comfortable enough to try out [the whole spectrum of CSS functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Functions) available!
